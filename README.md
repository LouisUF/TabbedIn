TabbedIn is a medical education game with the purpose of teaching kids about common mental and physical illnesses and how to prevent them!
Inspired by a retro-windows art style, Tabbed In has the player take on the role of a Body Systems Manager. 
In order to keep their "client" alive, the player must manage multiple different minigames simultaneously by using draggable windows-like "tabs".
By using minigames as the medium through which the information is delivered, Tabbed In hopes to provide an engaging and fun way for kids to learn more about medicine!
